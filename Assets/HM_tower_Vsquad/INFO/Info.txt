How to set up your own simple tower defence scene

1. Import an asset to Unity 2018.1.0 or above

2. Check Info_1 picture. Just drag and drop technical prefabs - Gate, Waypoint and Castle.

Gate is our spown enemy place. 

WayPoint is an intermediate place (in case if you have way with turns). You can dublicate 
these WayPoints as many as you want. After dublicating - you should add them to WaveSpawn script in Gate ( check info_3 picture )
Size - it`s how many waypoints you want to have except the castle. After choosing an amount of waypoints just drag and drop new waypoints from
Hierarchy to new rows in script

Castle is our finish place for enemies

ZONE in every tower means shooting range. Just scale it up if you need

IMPORTANT. After placing these cubes you have to apply changes to your prefabs of these cubes. Then enemies will go right


Info_1 - it`s common picture about placing technical cubes

Info_2 - It`s our lighting settings

Info_3 - It`s more difficult description about scripts. How to assign them to the towers. And how to set up
Probably you want to assign it to your own tower?
